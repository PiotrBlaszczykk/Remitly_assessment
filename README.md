# Remitly_assessment
assessment for Remitly Internship 2024
Piotr BÅ‚aszczyk

After cloning the repository, the setup is ready for execution.
When using an IDE, configure the Python interpreter to version 3.10, then simply execute main.py and UnitTests.py.

Alternatively, you can run python main.py and python UnitTests.py from the terminal while positioned within the Remitly_assessment directory.

main.py contains the verify(file_path) function, which is the primary element of this assessment. UnitTests.py, as the name implies, contains the unit tests.
The tests directory holds individual JSON files that are used for testing in the unit tests.
